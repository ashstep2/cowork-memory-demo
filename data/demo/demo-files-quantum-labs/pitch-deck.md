# Quantum Labs - Pitch Deck

## Company Overview
Quantum Labs uses AI to accelerate drug discovery. Our platform predicts molecular properties and optimizes drug candidates 10x faster than traditional methods.

## Problem
Drug discovery takes 10-15 years and costs $2.6B per approved drug. 90% of drug candidates fail in clinical trials. Pharma companies need better tools to predict efficacy and safety earlier in the pipeline.

## Solution
AI-powered platform for molecular design:
- **Predictive Models**: Trained on 100M+ molecular structures to predict binding affinity, toxicity, bioavailability
- **Generative Design**: AI generates novel molecules optimized for target proteins
- **Virtual Screening**: Screen 1M compounds in days vs. months with wet-lab experiments
- **Clinical Trial Prediction**: Estimate probability of success before entering trials

## Traction
- **$800K ARR**, growing 12% MoM
- **8 pharma customers** (mix of Big Pharma and biotech)
- **3 programs** in preclinical development using our platform
- **65% gross margin** (compute costs + data licensing)

## Market
$280B pharmaceutical R&D market, with $40B spent on drug discovery annually. AI-driven drug discovery is a $15B opportunity by 2030.

## Business Model
- **Platform License**: $100K-$500K annually per program
- **Success Fees**: 2-5% of milestone payments when drugs advance to trials
- **Enterprise**: Custom deals with Big Pharma ($1M+ ACV)

## Team
- **Dr. Priya Gupta (CEO)**: PhD Harvard CompBio, published 15 papers on AI for drug discovery
- **Alex Kim (CTO)**: Ex-DeepMind, worked on AlphaFold protein folding
- **15 employees**: 11 PhDs in biology, chemistry, or ML

## Fundraising
Raising **$8M seed extension** at **$32M pre-money** to:
- Validate 2 lead programs through IND filing
- Hire VP of Partnerships to close Big Pharma deals
- Expand compute infrastructure for larger molecular libraries

## Challenges & Risks
⚠️ **Customer Concentration**: Top customer is 28% of ARR (Merck partnership)
⚠️ **Runway Concern**: 14 months runway, need to close $3M+ in new ARR to extend
⚠️ **Proof Point Needed**: No drugs in clinical trials yet using our platform
⚠️ **Competitive Landscape**: Recursion, Insitro, Exscientia all well-funded
✓ **Strong Science**: Team has deep domain expertise and published research
✓ **Early Validation**: Customers are renewing and expanding contracts
