#  Bun - Acquisition Opportunity

## Company Overview
Bun is the fastest JavaScript runtime, rewritten in Zig. 3x faster than Node.js, with built-in bundler, transpiler, and package manager. **8M+ npm downloads/month**.

## Problem
Node.js is 15 years old and slow. Every JavaScript project needs separate tools (bundler, transpiler, test runner). Developers waste hours on tooling config.

## Solution
All-in-one JavaScript runtime with native speed. Drop-in replacement for Node.js with TypeScript, JSX, and bundling built-in. Zero configuration.

## Traction
- **8M+ monthly npm downloads** (fastest-growing runtime)
- **67K+ GitHub stars** in 2 years
- **Pre-revenue** (open source), but massive adoption
- Used by Vercel, Railway, and thousands of startups
- **120K+ Discord community members**

## Market
JavaScript is used by 19M+ developers. Runtime infrastructure is foundational—whoever controls it controls developer experience.

## Team
**Jarred Sumner (creator)** - legendary systems engineer. Ex-Stripe. Built Bun solo for 18 months, then raised $7M seed. Team of 7 elite engineers.

## Strategic Opportunity (Acquisition)
- **Infrastructure control**: Own the runtime layer for AI-assisted development
- **Claude Code integration**: Bun's speed = better Claude developer experience
- **Talent acquisition**: Jarred is a 10x systems engineer
- **Ecosystem moat**: Differentiate Anthropic's developer tools from OpenAI

## Strategic Rationale
✅ Vercel (OpenAI partner) runs on Node.js/Next.js
✅ Anthropic could own the faster, better runtime stack
✅ Bun + Claude Code = unbeatable developer platform
✅ Pre-revenue = acquire for talent + tech, not expensive

## Ask
**$25M acquisition** (talent + IP). Team stays intact. Bun becomes open-source infrastructure for Claude ecosystem.
