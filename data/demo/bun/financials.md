# Bun - Financial Details

## Business Model
- **Pre-revenue** (100% open source)
- No monetization yet - pure developer tool
- Funding: $7M seed from Y Combinator, Kleiner Perkins

## Burn & Runway
- **Monthly Burn**: $180K (mostly salaries)
- **Cash**: $2.5M remaining
- **Runway**: 14 months ⚠️ Need capital or exit

## Developer Adoption
- **8M+ monthly npm downloads** (growing 40% MoM)
- **67K GitHub stars** (top 0.1% of all repos)
- **120K Discord members** (engaged community)
- **Production usage**: Vercel, Railway, Shopify, Cloudflare Workers

## Technical Metrics
- **3x faster** than Node.js for most workloads
- **2x faster** than Deno
- **90%+ Node.js API compatibility** (drop-in replacement)
- Native TypeScript/JSX support (no config needed)
- Built-in test runner, bundler, package manager

## Acquisition Rationale

### Why Now
- 14 months runway = motivated seller
- Pre-revenue = acquire at talent + IP value (~$25M)
- OpenAI hasn't moved on developer infrastructure yet
- JavaScript developers are Claude's fastest-growing user segment

### Strategic Value
- **Own the runtime layer** (infrastructure control)
- **Bun + Claude Code** = integrated developer platform
- **Talent**: Jarred Sumner is world-class (systems + dev tools)
- **Differentiation**: Faster, better stack than OpenAI ecosystem
- **Moat**: Make Claude the obvious choice for JavaScript developers

### Integration Plan
- Keep Bun open source (community goodwill)
- Integrate with Claude Code for optimized performance
- Build native Claude SDK into Bun runtime
- Position as "Bun: The AI-native JavaScript runtime"

### Risks
- Pre-revenue acquisition (no proven business model)
- Community backlash if commercialized wrong
- Need to maintain open source credibility

## Recommendation
✅ **ACQUIRE for $25M**. Jarred + team join Anthropic Developer Tools.
- Bun stays open source but becomes "Powered by Anthropic"
- Integrate deeply with Claude Code and API
- Ship "Claude Runtime" using Bun as foundation
- Strategic hedge against OpenAI owning developer tooling stack
