# GreenTech Inc - Pitch Deck

## Company Overview
GreenTech is building a marketplace connecting businesses with renewable energy producers.

## Problem
Small businesses want to buy renewable energy but lack access to clean energy credits and PPAs (Power Purchase Agreements).

## Solution
Two-sided marketplace:
- **For Buyers**: SMBs can purchase renewable energy credits with transparent pricing
- **For Sellers**: Solar farms and wind projects can sell directly to end customers

## Traction
⚠️ **Pre-revenue** - launched beta 2 months ago
- 12 businesses signed up for waitlist
- 3 renewable energy producers in talks
- No signed contracts yet

## Market
$250B renewable energy market, growing 20% annually as companies commit to carbon neutrality goals.

## Business Model
- **Take Rate**: 8% commission on transactions
- **Target**: $10M GMV in Year 1 → $800K revenue

## Team
- **Jordan Taylor (CEO)**: Ex-McKinsey consultant, Harvard MBA, no climate tech experience
- **⚠️ No CTO**: Relying on outsourced dev shop
- **5 employees**: All business/ops, no engineers

## Fundraising
Raising **$3M pre-seed** at **$10M pre-money**

## 🚩 RED FLAGS - CLEAR PASS
❌ **Pre-revenue**: $0 ARR, no signed customers
❌ **No CTO**: Can't build tech product without technical co-founder
❌ **Tight Runway**: 8 months, burning $150K/month with $0 revenue
❌ **Team Gap**: No domain expertise in climate tech or energy markets
❌ **Crowded Market**: Competing against Arcadia, WattTime, LevelTen Energy (all well-funded)
❌ **High Valuation**: $10M pre-money for pre-revenue is aggressive
❌ **Regulatory Risk**: Energy markets heavily regulated, team has no experience
❌ **Execution Risk**: Outsourced dev + no CTO = product quality concerns

## RECOMMENDATION: **HARD PASS**
- Come back when you have a technical co-founder
- Need proof of revenue ($500K+ ARR minimum)
- Runway too short for pre-revenue company
- Team lacks domain expertise for regulated market
