# GreenTech Inc - Financial Details

## Current State
⚠️ **PRE-REVENUE**
- **ARR**: $0
- **MRR**: $0
- **Customers**: 0 paying customers (12 waitlist signups)

## Burn Analysis
- **Monthly Burn**: $150K
- **Cash Balance**: $1.2M
- **Runway**: 8 months ⚠️ **CRITICAL**

## Burn Breakdown
- **Salaries**: $80K/month (5 employees @ avg $192K comp)
- **Outsourced Dev**: $40K/month (offshore team)
- **Marketing**: $15K/month
- **Legal/Admin**: $15K/month

## Projections (Unvalidated)
**Year 1**: $800K revenue (assumes $10M GMV @ 8% take rate)
**Year 2**: $3.2M revenue (assumes $40M GMV)

⚠️ **Concerns with Projections:**
- No customer validation yet
- Energy marketplace requires regulatory approvals (6-12 months)
- Competing against funded incumbents
- No proof team can execute

## Capital Requirements
**Immediate**: $3M to get to 18-month runway
**Future**: Will need $10M+ Series A to scale marketplace

## 🚩 FINANCIAL RED FLAGS
❌ **Zero Revenue**: No proof of PMF or customer demand
❌ **8-Month Runway**: Can't build marketplace + get regulatory approval in 8 months
❌ **High Burn**: $150K/month with no revenue is unsustainable
❌ **Outsourced Dev**: $40K/month outsource cost with no internal CTO is risky
❌ **Valuation Mismatch**: $10M pre for pre-revenue is 10-20x industry standard

## Decision Matrix
**PASS Factors (All Present):**
- Pre-revenue
- No technical co-founder
- <12 month runway
- No domain expertise
- Outsourced product development
- Regulatory complexity without expertise
- High valuation for stage

**Would Reconsider If:**
- Add technical co-founder with energy/climate background
- Get to $500K+ ARR with real customers
- Secure LOIs from 5+ enterprise customers
- Lower valuation to $3-5M pre-money

## Verdict: **HARD PASS**
Come back in 12-18 months with:
1. CTO hired
2. $500K+ ARR
3. Regulatory approvals in progress
4. More reasonable valuation
