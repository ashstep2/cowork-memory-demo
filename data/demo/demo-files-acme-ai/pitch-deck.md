# Acme AI - Pitch Deck

## Company Overview
Acme AI is building the operating system for enterprise automation. We use AI agents to automate complex business workflows that have traditionally required human judgment.

## Problem
Enterprises spend $4.5T annually on knowledge work that could be automated. Current RPA tools are brittle and require constant maintenance. LLMs enable a new paradigm: agents that can handle exceptions, learn from feedback, and adapt to changing processes.

## Solution
Our platform allows non-technical users to deploy AI agents across their enterprise workflows:
- **Agent Builder**: No-code interface to define agent behaviors and guardrails
- **Workflow Engine**: Orchestrate multi-step processes with human-in-the-loop controls
- **Integration Hub**: Pre-built connectors to 200+ enterprise systems (Salesforce, SAP, Workday, etc.)
- **Observability**: Real-time monitoring, audit trails, and explainable AI decisions

## Traction
- **$4.5M ARR**, growing 18% MoM
- **340 customers** including 3 Fortune 500 companies
- **128% NRR** - customers expanding rapidly after initial deployment
- **82% gross margin** - software-like economics

## Market
$85B TAM in enterprise automation software, growing 24% annually as AI capabilities improve. We're positioned at the intersection of RPA ($3B), BPM ($10B), and emerging AI agent platforms.

## Business Model
- **Platform Fee**: $50K/year minimum
- **Agent Credits**: $0.10 per agent execution (average customer runs 50K/month)
- **Enterprise**: Custom pricing for Fortune 500 ($500K+ ACV)

## Team
- **Sarah Chen (CEO)**: Ex-Stripe Product Lead, built Stripe Billing from 0 to $2B ARR
- **Marcus Rodriguez (CTO)**: Ex-Google Brain, PhD from MIT, 3 patents in AI systems
- **28 employees**: 60% engineering, veterans from Stripe, Google, Anthropic

## Fundraising
Raising **$15M Series A** at **$75M pre-money** to:
- Expand enterprise sales team (5 → 20 AEs)
- Build vertical-specific agent templates (Finance, HR, Legal)
- Invest in security & compliance for regulated industries

## Strategic Fit for Anthropic
- **Claude Integration**: 80% of our agents use Claude API
- **Feedback Loop**: Production data from 340 enterprises improves Claude for agentic use cases
- **Enterprise GTM**: We're selling into the same Fortune 500 accounts
- **Talent**: World-class team at intersection of AI and enterprise software
